        <p>A school project I've been working on the side was learning how to use blender. My goal is to create a video game but in order to do that I need to learn on how to make 3D models for my game. I had to look up alot of different youtube videos to help me.
          I was also super lucky to have one of my teachers give me tutorials to learn the program. A challenge I had to overcome was knowing the risk that I could lose all of my progress if the program were to crash. Which helps me so it wouldn't discourage me to 
          not keep going. Here are a few things I've made. </p>

      <p>In this game you are basically playing as a spaceship trying to kill the enemies that appear on screen. There is a one power up that helps you have a shotgun ability. This ability helps you kill enemies faster.
        Goal is to not die and reach then end, get the highest score, and go through the portal. </p>
